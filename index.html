    <h2>🌱 My Learning Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Over the past years, I have learned how to grow not only academically but also emotionally.
      Through the <strong>GRIT program</strong>, I discovered the power of perseverance and self-discipline.
      I was proud to earn the <strong>“Nuôi Em Công Nghệ” scholarship</strong>, which supported my passion for technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I continuously develop myself by joining <strong>summer camps</strong>, <strong>workshops</strong>, and studying English at <strong>GLOW English Center</strong>.
      These experiences have helped me become more confident, improve my communication, and strengthen my mindset.
