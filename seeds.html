    <h2>💖 The Value of SEEDS</h2>
    <p>
      SEEDS taught me that education is not just about knowledge, but also about kindness, sharing, and growth.
      I am deeply grateful for the opportunities and guidance from mentors who inspire me to pursue my dreams and help others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through SEEDS, I learned to become a more responsible student and an active member of my community.

      <h2>🌺 My Gratitude Message</h2>

      <p>
        I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the <strong>Pacific Links Foundation</strong> and all the
        dedicated mentors, coordinators, and sponsors behind the <strong>SEEDS Scholarship</strong>.
        You have opened a door of hope for me — a student who dares to dream, to grow, and to create a better future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to SEEDS, I’ve been able to continue my studies with confidence and determination.
        The guidance, workshops, and community activities have helped me improve not only my academic results but also
        my leadership, empathy, and self-awareness.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am especially thankful to the <strong>program coordinators and mentors</strong> who always encourage me to learn more,
        believe in myself, and step out of my comfort zone.  
        Every message, every workshop, and every meeting reminds me how meaningful education can be when it comes with love and care.
      </p>

      <p>
        I promise to use this opportunity wisely — to study hard, give back to my community, and one day become a person
        who can also help others, just as SEEDS has helped me.
      </p>
